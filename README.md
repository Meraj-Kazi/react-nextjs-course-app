# React & NextJS Course Application - 01. Initial Setup


Follow these steps:

- open terminal
- run command ``` npx create-next-app next-news ```
- Open the folder into VS Code or any text editor.
- get rid of index page inside pages folder, delete api folder, delete module css file from style folder.
- Make 2 pages inside pages folder called index.js and news.js
- add relevent code in those two.
- now open terminal and run the project using this command ```npm run dev```
- view the app on localhost:3000
- Now if you visit localhost:3000, you'll see indexJS page loaded.
- If you want to see the newsJS page, visit localhost:3000/news. Also, if you move newsJS file into a folder called news, inside pages folder, and name the newsJS page as indexJS, it'll still be available on localhost:3000/news. It's upto you. It's better for making nested pages.
- BUt if wanna load anything dynamic in our news page, we need to use ### Dynamic Paths
